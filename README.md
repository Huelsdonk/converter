# Converter

A nifty (I find it useful, anyway) little Python function that converts ingredients from volume measurements to weight in grams and writes the results to an adjacent text file. I made this a few different ways, but using a dictionary defintely seems to work the best. It's really easy to add or remove key/value pairs without having to change the rest of the code.
